<h1>Interactive State Map </h1>
<h2>a Project Proposal</h2>
<p> I recently worked for the <a href="http://census.gov">United States - Census Bureau</a>. As a result I am keenly aware of the massive amounts of demographic information they've collected over time, including from the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey. 
</p>

<p>
	What I would like to do is create an interact map of the United States.
	The map would be divided up by states. And when users clicked on one of the states, it would focus in 	on the state and provide interactive data about the state. 
</p>

<h2> Utility</h2>
<p> I believe that such a project could be very educational. People often struggle with things like statics and data sets. With proper visualization, visitors could become more engaged and learn about different parts of the country. </p>

<h2> Sketches</h2>

<p> The highlighted state would bring up graphs and charts that can show both the change over time, and also the current composition. Examples would be overall population growth over the last ten years. Or the current distribution of minorities.
