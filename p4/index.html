	<h2>Proposal for P4 </h2>
	
	<p> My goal is to further extend my project that I created for <a href="p3.benwu.me">P3</a></p>
	<p> There are a few aspects of the project that I would like to improve</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Allow visualization of alternate datasets</li>
		<li>Allow a user to enter their own dataset to visualize</li>
		<li>Allow a user to create an account and save their visualizations</li>
		<li>Be able to dynamically fetch the needed information (possibly using ajax?)</li>
		<li>Added use of plotting and graphing jquery plugins, suggestions here would be helpful</li>	
	</ul>
	<p> Project as of P3 </p>

	<p>A few alterations</p>
	<p> additional pages for adding a data set to be created, but not sure about best UI for that element 	yet.</p>
